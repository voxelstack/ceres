ceres is a UI framework for the web built around observables.
It works by making small changes to the DOM whenever your data changes, and it feels like writing svelte with hyperscript.

```typescript
const Greeter = $createComponent<{ greeting: string }>(($props) => {
  const name = $store("there");

  return $element(
    "div",
    {},
    $element("input", { type: "text", bind: { value: name } }),
    $element(
      "button",
      { on: { click: () => (name.value = "ceres") } },
      "Greet myself"
    ),
    $element("span", {}, $format`${$props.greeting} ${name}!`)
  );
});

const app = Greeter({ greeting: "Hey" });
app.mount(document.body);
```
